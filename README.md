## Introduction

CMake is a build system for projects build with C or C++ programmig language. There are many build system for C/C++ but CMake is the most popular one. This repo will contain my practice for building project using C/C++. I will mainly use C++ as a programming language for this repo but almost everything is applicable for C language too.
